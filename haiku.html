    <h3>Haiku from my first year of college</h3>
           <p>I began writing haiku during my first year of college. Because I entered in the fall of 2020, this was during the height of the pandemic. What I thought a first year of college was “supposed” to look like were fundamentally uprooted. It was hard to make friends. My classes were all virtual. For a teenager fresh out of high school and fed on dreams of the good life that college represents, this was a major disapointment that I struggled to overcome. I was often bored and lonely and sad because I felt like I had missed two of the most important phases of my life to a pandemic: my senior year of high school and my first year of college.</p>

           <p>Sometime in September, I discovered Issa and Basho, and soon bought several of their haiku books. I must've read them each five or six times, my first semester. And they inspired me of a way to deal with what I was feeling. When I had nothing else to do I would walk alone across grounds and try to find beauty, humor, anything to make this college experience feel meaningful at all. </p>

           <p>I follow a haiku tradition in which a haiku is three lines short enough to be said in just one breath. </p>

<p>losing his antlers <br>
the buck enters the ark <br>
    slowly…</p>

<p>The third snow arrives!<br>
to empty streets<br>
and closed doors</p>

<p>A crane's reflection --<br>
What does he see? His beaks<br>
merge, and produce two fish. </p>

<p>Just after the rain – <br>
a hawk sits on the roof<br>
and prays.</p>

<p>The bus is also<br>
going nowhere<br>
in this warm night. </p>

<p>Wondering when it will end – <br>
the guitar whispers, <br>
the night bus passes. </p>

<p>Little spider’s web<br>
holding the bridge<br>
together</p>

<p>It’s harvest season – <br>
I’m stuffing myself with<br>
microwave mac and cheese</p>

<p>Crazy autumn moon!<br>
Don’t you know <br>
You’ll never catch the sun?</p>

<p>4 flights of concrete stairs,<br>
a backpack<br>
full of beer</p>

<p>Friday morning – <br>
I can’t catch up<br>
to my shadow. </p>

<p>My shadow carries me<br>
down the street...<br>
early morning blues. </p>

<p>Hello mosquito – <br>
What are you <br>
here to say?</p>

<p>It’s late Mr. Mosquito – <br>
tell me your news <br>
and go</p>

<p>They tell me grand things <br>
but I just don’t care…<br>
napping in the Parthenon. </p>

           <h3> Haiku from my third year of college. </h3> 

           <p>Having returned to the University of Virginia after a summer working in Morocco, I had a new perspective on what I wanted out of college. I had made friends who fundamentally shifted the way I wanted to be. This year became a year of self-contemplation, of reflection. I no longer felt the compulsion to color my world with beauty as a way to combat the ugliness of my life. Two years of haiku writing, of appreciating the phenomenal, had brought beauty into my world. </p> 

<p>Why does the sunset <br>
only shine on the <br>
highest trees? </p>

<p>The cow meets <br>
othercow, drinking <br>
pond water. </p>

<p>The not-leaves in the tree <br>
quiet when I approach <br>
and take flight. </p>

<p>A thousand blackbirds <br>
twirl like not-snow <br>
on not-wind. </p>

<p>The old hawk <br>
(without moving)<br>
glides across the sky. </p>

<p>The buzzard on the fence <br>
shifts from one foot <br>
to the other. </p>
           
<p>It’s november – <br>
and the bugs chirp <br>
like alone on a stage. </p>
           
<p>Without noise, <br>
without confusion – <br>
november rain. </p>
           
<p>Our footsteps whisper <br>
across vigil grounds <br>
like november rain. </p>
           
<p>This sky meets <br>
another sky – <br>
so still is the creek. </p>
           
<p>My reflection – <br>
obscured by a <br>
condom in the water. </p>
           
<p>Maple branches <br>
like cracks in the <br>
china blue sky. </p>
           
<p>These maple branches <br>
are cracks <br>
in the china blue sky. </p>
           
<p>Finding between two branches <br>
a hypotenuse! <br>
the squirrel leaps. </p>
           
<p>The winter sunset <br>
burns so bright <br>
but warms nothing... </p>
           
<p>The burning winter sunset <br>
is enough warmth <br>
for me! </p>
           
<p>Winter trees <br>
and their shadows <br>
like prison bars. </p>
           
<p>Winter trees <br>
and their shadows <br>
like new alphabets! </p>
           
<p>A slagmetal sunset <br>
like in a world yet <br>
becoming. </p>
           
<p>The poet’s shadow <br>
contemplates him <br>
just the same. </p>
