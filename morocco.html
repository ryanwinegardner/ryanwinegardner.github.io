    <h2 id=post1>In the Place of Destruction </h2>
        <h3>July 2022 </h3>
<p> It has been said that the meaning of the place Jemaa el Fna in Marrakech is roughly untranslatable, but that one of the approximations in English can be understood to mean "the place of destruction." I find this name not only fitting but perhaps even commensurate with whatever its name truly is, because the beauty of this name is enough that it Should be true. The Place of Destruction. A square where everyday there is a constant stirring and agitation and spectacle. There are juice stands, snake charmers, and monkey trainers during the day. At noon you can find tourists standing there, sweating, often nervous, wondering what the hell they have just stepped into. There are street peddlers, soccer games, and horse carriages as the evening begins to cool. People begin to take down some of the juice stands. People begin to set up the rows and rows of dinner stands, serving all kinds of food from meat skewers to snail soup. As night falls, the storytellers, the musicians, the tricksters, the oddballs, the magicians, the hacks, and the virtuosos all arrive in force. The evening prayer resounds across the expanse. Everyone looks at the Mosque. It hangs over the Place of Destruction like a monument to a force that could blot out this scene once and forever. Throughout all of this, the Place of Destruction is ever-changing, ever-stirring, always new and always disappearing and reappearing. I think it must be some reflection of the creation of the universe that has been shot out through some wormhole or other malfunction of the universe's fabric and refracted and scrambled and reassembled in a way that is at once both physical and yet entirely mystic. Once, billions of years ago the whole universe was just dust and rocks and ice floating and changing and stirring around clouds of nothingness, and from this there emerged Beauty and Goodness and Life. Jemaa el Fna. Another meaning of Jemaa el Fna is rendered as the Mosque at the End of the World. The Place of Destruction. the Mosque at the End of the World. </p>

<p> Recently, I visited the city Beni Mellal, and after an intercultural dialogue through my office about religion, race, geography, and gender with the local university students, we were invited to a cafe on top of a rise overlooking the old fort there and the city and beyond that, the valley. As the sun set, the sky overhead was a dark blue while the horizon burned orange. The roads ran outward to the horizon where they disappeared in a parallax that destroyed every feature except for their symmetry. It was a place where all things converged as though the order of the universe dictated that all things must converge. This point in the distance was shrouded in the haze and vapor of the cooling earth. It was unimaginably far away but it felt like the disappearing point was right there in front of me. Like I could reach out and grasp the curtain of existence and pull it back and see the machinery and the backdrops and the actors decostumed backstage. It was a moment both of joy and of vertigo — the end of the world, right here before me. It was a place of destruction at the end of the world, and it was the purest Beauty one could ever witness. A feeling like walking into Jemaa el Fna for the first time.</p>

    <h2 id=post2> On Planting a Tree</h2>
    
    <h3>August 2022</h3>

        <p>There is a great horror that can sometimes overwhelm me while doing development work. It was maybe at its greatest when the office took us to visit Al Haouz province to plant trees with the community members: the beginning of a project to plant eighty thousand olive, carob, and almond trees, and water them all with solar-powered pumps. Halfway through the day, I stepped back from the work and just stood there and stared. It was a shadeless hillside over the valley that was all rock and dirt. The forty or fifty volunteers and community members were toiling against this landscape like a colony of little ants in the dust under the cruel and indifferent eye of the sun. </p>

        <p>Back home, in Virginia, it often feels like the sun is angry, like it is a malignant force attacking everything beneath it, but in Morocco, the sun is not even angry. It simply hangs fixedly overhead, a flat disc in a sky the color of shattered glass. There is no thought of resistance because it entirely dominates. All that can be done is to obey. And in the middle of that field, after planting trees for several hours, I was overwhelmed with anxiety over such a powerful force. <>

        <p>I looked out and thought about how long it would take to plant eighty thousand trees, and how it can take fifteen years for a carob tree to bear fruit, and how the global temperature is rising by something like two degrees Celsius, and rising and rising ever-faster, and I wondered with alarm what this hillside would even look like in fifteen years. Would it provide shade and comfort and protection? Would it be a paradise of carob and olive and almond? In fifteen years, would there be children running between the trunks? Or would it be a landscape still dominated by the sun? Would the trees wither and die from drought? How could a sapling that could fit easily in the palm of my hand — and be crushed in it — even hope to survive in this landscape? Would they be beaten down and dried out until only those that clung to the uphill shadows remained? Would not just the trees but even the shade be eradicated? Alone away from the tree planting, I had to suppress my nausea at the prospect. </p>

        <p>I was reminded of a biblical passage: “Yet when I surveyed all that my hands had done and what I had toiled to achieve, everything was meaningless, a chasing after the wind; nothing was gained under the sun” (Ecclesiastes 2: 11). </p>

        <p>I was reminded that this problem is not new, though it is so daunting that it feels insurmountable and world-ending to everyone who comes across it. It is the meaninglessness of building sand castles at the beach, knowing that the tide may come and wash it away. It is the meaninglessness that frightened even wise King Solomon in Ecclesiastes. Trying to make the world a little better can feel meaningless in the face of challenges that are monstrously crawling closer. The horror of development work is that you can work from dawn to dusk in the field trying to improve the world, only for this work to be erased as if by the spirit of some vengeful god.</p>

        <p>Yet, alone there away from the tree planting site in Al Haouz, I found strength. I thought about the generations of authors who have written about meaninglessness. I remembered the Book of Ecclesiastes, I remembered the Buddhist texts I’ve read, and I remembered The Myth of Sisyphus, who is perpetually rolling that rock up that hill. Even more importantly, I considered my own experience in Morocco. I thought about the people I've met, the ones who live every day working tirelessly (through pain and resistance and doubt) in projects like this. I thought about those workers and volunteers and community members who will not bow even to the power of the sun, who stand up with pick and shovel and sapling and work every day.</p>

        <p>These trees are not immortal, and this project will face numerous and overwhelming challenges in the future. We do not work to shape the earth for all of eternity. We do not work for some timeless monument; we work because the work is good. If there is even a tiny chance that these trees can improve people’s lives, that in a generation from now there will be children running in the shade of the forest we have planted, then we must work. In fact, we must not just work; we must travail. </p>

    <h2 id=post3>The Long Return </h2>
    <h3> September 2022</h3>    
        <p>Seeing the magnolia trees in the forest (and smelling the elegiac flowers and hearing the elegiac cicadas on the elegiac boughs) was like one lover going on a journey so long and distant that they had to say goodbye to the beloved, and departing on a ship to some land so foreign that the lover forgot even that they had a beloved in the first place, becoming so entrenched in such strange notions and languages and customs to have their own idea of love erased as if by some bitter wind blowing on the sand castles at the beach, and growing out their hair or cutting their hair, and wearing new clothes or forsaking clothes, and becoming obsessed with money or becoming obsessed with idols, and changing so entirely that even the concept of the beloved has too been erased — then, through accident or conspiracy or revolution, the lover is flung or deported or exiled from the new land that is now the lover’s land, and returns to the old land that is no longer the lover’s land, and returning sees the beloved once again and for just one brief moment stands entirely naked before space and time and circumstance and forgets the span of strange notions and languages and customs, and remembers for that one brief moment how things were before leaving. And then the nakedness is stolen by space and time and sun and circumstance, and the lover’s new clothes and notions and languages and customs reassert themselves. And the love is not there. Instead: confusion. </p>

    <h2 id=post4>Zen in Old Cemeteries </h2>
    <h3>June 2023</h3>
        
        <p>In the fog at the third school we visited outside Tiznit, I stood on the rocks on the hill and wondered what lay beyond. I could see only a few meters out because of the fog, which hung like a great white curtain separating me from the world, and I tried to enjoy this brief moment.</p> 

        <p>My time in Marrakech has been busy (for good reason): I've been shepherded and paraded and led all around in a constant commotion, meeting many people and listening to many more. Outside of work, the other UVa kids have inspired me to go out and explore and have fun as much as possible. I've learned much about myself and seen many things. It feels like I've been in Marrakech for years now, even though it has really only been three weeks. This tumult has taught me to truly appreciate the moments of peace that are offered by life: lounging by the pool at our riad outside Essaouira, sitting on the balcony with my friends, entering a zen mindset while writing an article, or standing in the fog up high in the sky somewhere in the countryside of Souss-Massa. Even with all of life's suffering and distractions and illusions, there is true Beauty written into the code of things. I've learned there is perhaps a Calculus, that while not entirely reciprocal, does at least account for the pain, and so produces something worthwhile out of it. Not that my time in Marrakech has been painful, but I have often felt confused, and I have seen pain here.</p>

<p>Soon afterwards, we visited a Jewish cemetery in Tiznit. Here, I was captivated by the guardian's story, but I was also amazed by an ant colony. Marching in columns back and forth across the cemetery grounds, these ants moved in a geometry that felt poetic in some way. They had unity, maybe even love among themselves. And it was a whole city of creatures inhabiting the dust to which sixty-one Jewish people had returned. A hallowed ground, a resting place, and an entire cosmos all in one plot of land. Who is to say that heaven isn't like the ant colony there, the ant colony from which I could feel so much beauty radiating? Or what about the hillside and the school hanging in the fog high in the sky over the sunset coast? It reminded me of a moment from my first year of college, when the grounds of the University of Virginia felt more like a crypt than a campus: <p>

        <p style= "color: #339933">Sweeping up the flowers <br>
        on the tomb, spring wind <br>
        promises spring rain </p>
        
	    <p style= "color: #339933">A crane's reflection – <br>
        What does he see? His beaks <br>
        merge, and produce two fish.</p>

        <p>Or maybe even this quote, said to be the last of words of Copernicus: 
            
        <p style= "color: #339933">"the beauty of this world is not in its loneliness, but in the gossamer tenure between its constituent things; therefore, it’s beautiful not that the dog yaps, but that you can even hear it." </p>

        <p>Anyways, we left this place that had made me feel strange emotions. Somewhere halfway through the five-hour bus ride (a ride through the half-lidded, indigo mountains between Tiznit and Marrakech, a ride that shot through the dark like the Chariot of Apollo riding across the sunset) I got terribly sick and had to stop the bus. I jumped into a gas station bathroom and threw up till my nose bled. I was okay, but nonetheless rather uncomfortable. Yet still, leaving the bathroom, I sat down by the road and watched all my friends from a distance. They were in a kind of harmony here. It felt good. It was like the ant colony in the Jewish cemetery in Tiznit. </p>
