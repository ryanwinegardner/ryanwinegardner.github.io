    <h2>Why this website?</h2>
    <div>
     <p>I learned html and coded this website after talking to my friend, Amit Vallabh, who had recently done something similar. He said it would be a great way to showcase my writing and my thoughts. While I've never been a CS kid, he convinced me it would be easy enough for me to do this. I'm not sure if it was as easy as he said, but I actually found it a fun experience to learn html and make something tangible. This has certainly been a rewarding experience, as I continue to learn website building. </p>


    <p>So, I made this website to showcase my writing. This is something deeply important to me. If you continue to read this website, you will see how the art of writing has gotten me through tough times, and helped make me the person I am today. </p>

    <h2>Why Write?</h2>    
<p>I've heard it said, maybe in a class on the origins of thought, or whispered by an old man passing in the street, that the seers of old were not believed to write the stories they shared. Instead it was believed that these people heard the prophetic words they spoke and that they read the prose they wrote from somewhere deep in the murmuring of the earth's crust and in the winnowing of its air. 
 </p>

<p>What a view of the universe! of language! That we and our systems of thought and the universe are essentially in communication. And since I heard this, wherever I heard it, I've always hoped it was not just true of the bygone seers who wrote the bible and the epic of gilgamesh and moby dick and the vedas, but also true of writers nowadays. Or at least just some. </p>
    
<p>Because to be in communication with the universe means there is still something hidden in it. That there is something worth being said by the wind, that there is still mystery deep in the woods and high in the mountains. And hope for us. </p>

<p>Something has always drawn me to write, and I'm not exactly sure what. I remember bored days in the sick heat of rural virginia, imagining myself in some nostalgic elsewhere, maybe a powerful druid in secret warfare against the romans, maybe a warrior alone on some just mission. Imagining other realities, and those yet hidden to us. In this way, writing and storytelling has always held something dear to me, something that holds yet untapped beauty. 
</p>
<p>I've always found inspiration in Faulkner's nobel speech:</p>
    <p style= "color: #339933">"the writer must teach himself that the basest of all things is to be afraid; and, teaching himself that, forget it forever, leaving no room in his workshop for anything but the old verities and truths of the heart, the old universal truths lacking which any story is ephemeral and doomed – love and honor and pity and pride and compassion and sacrifice. Until he does so, he labors under a curse. He writes not of love but of lust, of defeats in which nobody loses anything of value, of victories without hope and, worst of all, without pity or compassion. His griefs grieve on no universal bones, leaving no scars. He writes not of the heart but of the glands."</p>
    <p style= "color: #339933"> Until he relearns these things, he will write as though he stood among and watched the end of man. I decline to accept the end of man. It is easy enough to say that man is immortal simply because he will endure: that when the last dingdong of doom has clanged and faded from the last worthless rock hanging tideless in the last red and dying evening, that even then there will still be one more sound: that of his puny inexhaustible voice, still talking. I refuse to accept this. I believe that man will not merely endure: he will prevail. He is immortal, not because he alone among creatures has an inexhaustible voice, but because he has a soul, a spirit capable of compassion and sacrifice and endurance." </p>
    
    <p>After reading this speech, I've hoped I can write in this way, to uphold the compassion and sacrifice of the human soul. I think that writing is an art that can unlock things, that even if we are cursed to be born and die soon thereafter, that we can etch our passings in stone, that we can contribute to a bigger fabric. Or maybe I just write because I like it. If so, I think there are more meaningless things someone can do with their time. </p>
